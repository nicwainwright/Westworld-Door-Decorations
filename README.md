Here are an alphabet's worth of files for WESTWORLD themed Door Decorations for RA's.
The purpose is to create semi-customized door decorations of Westworld theme for each resident based on his/her/their name.
I am an RA at Duke University and I made these for the 2018-2019 school year.

The Westworld white android character was found on Google images using the search parameter "Licensed for non-commerical reuse with modification" so it does not conflict with any copyright laws.

I will refer to the collective photoshop documents as 'the file' from here on.

The file contains 4 main elements:
	- the westworld guy
	- the background
	- the resident's name
	- the blue mask

The westworld guy was extracted using selection wand from the 'coverPerson.jpg' file.

The background folder has a photo of Moab, Utah I found on the web that is also on many westworld-related pages.
It has some style edits to make it look as I thought it should.

The resident's name is written in 200pt font of Open Sans Semibold (free, no cost) to resemble the Westworld font.

The blue mask is created as follows:
	- type the first letter of resident's name in ~1000pt font Open Sans in white.
	- rasterize the layer
	- create additional layers as desired to add in extra white blocks to mimic the letter extensions 
		- example: for the letter 'W', create additional slashes ->   \W/
	- merge the layers of the white letter and the additional blocks
	- hide all layers except for the merged layer you just created
	- Select->Color Range-> Highlights-> OK
		- then Select->Inverse
			- this will select everything that isnt the letter you created
	- Then use the Paint Bucket tool to fill in the slection with color: #091b24
	- Then Select->Inverse again to select the letters and press Delete while the layer is selected to make it see through
	- Set this layer to 90% opacity
	- Turn on visibilty for other layers and make sure that the heirarchy is residentName(top), person, letter mask, bacground(bottom)
	- DONE!
